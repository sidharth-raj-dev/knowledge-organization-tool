# Understanding the Longest Palindrome Problem: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction
Finding the longest palindrome in a string is a classic algorithmic problem that tests understanding of string manipulation and two-pointer technique. This article breaks down the solution into manageable steps and explains each component in detail.

## The Problem Statement
Given a string, find the longest palindromic substring within it. For example:
- Input: "racecar" → Output: "racecar"
- Input: "abba" → Output: "abba"
- Input: "babad" → Output: "bab" or "aba"

## Core Algorithm Steps
1. Start at each character in the string and treat it as a center point
2. For each center point, expand outwards in both directions as long as characters match
3. Do this twice for each position:
   - Once for odd length palindromes (single center)
   - Once for even length palindromes (double center)
4. Keep track of the start index and length of the longest palindrome found
5. Return the substring using these tracked values

## Detailed Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Iterating Through Centers
```python
for i in range(len(s)):
    # i becomes our center point
```
This seemingly simple step is crucial as it ensures we check every possible palindrome center in the string. Each position could be the center of either an odd-length or even-length palindrome.

### Step 2: The Expansion Logic
The expansion helper function is where the core palindrome checking happens:
```python
def expandAroundCenter(s, left, right):
    while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
        left -= 1
        right += 1
    return right - left - 1
```

The constraints in the while loop are critical:
1. `left >= 0`: Prevents going beyond the start of string
2. `right < len(s)`: Prevents going beyond the end of string
3. `s[left] == s[right]`: Ensures palindrome property is maintained

### Step 3: Handling Both Odd and Even Length Palindromes
For each position, we need to check both possibilities:
```python
# Odd length palindromes (single center)
len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i)

# Even length palindromes (double center)
len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1)
```

Examples:
- Odd length "racecar":
  - Center at 'e'
  - Expands to "racecar"
- Even length "abba":
  - Centers at both 'b's
  - Expands to "abba"

### Step 4: Tracking the Longest Palindrome
We keep track of two crucial pieces of information:
```python
start = 0   # starting index of longest palindrome
maxLen = 0  # length of longest palindrome

if currLen > maxLen:
    maxLen = currLen
    start = i - (currLen - 1) // 2
```

The start index calculation `i - (currLen - 1) // 2` is crucial:
- For odd length palindromes: Centers us perfectly
- For even length palindromes: Gives us the correct starting point

### Step 5: Final Return
```python
return s[start:start + maxLen]
```
This step simply extracts the longest palindrome using our tracked start index and length.

## Complete Solution
```python
def longestPalindrome(s):
    def expandAroundCenter(s, left, right):
        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
            left -= 1
            right += 1
        return right - left - 1
    
    start = 0
    maxLen = 0
    
    for i in range(len(s)):
        len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i)
        len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1)
        
        currLen = max(len1, len2)
        if currLen > maxLen:
            maxLen = currLen
            start = i - (currLen - 1) // 2
    
    return s[start:start + maxLen]
```

## Common Pitfalls and Tips

1. **Boundary Checking**: Don't forget the three crucial checks in expandAroundCenter:
   - Left boundary
   - Right boundary
   - Character matching

2. **Start Index Calculation**: The formula `i - (currLen - 1) // 2` accounts for both odd and even length palindromes:
   - For odd length: Centers perfectly on the middle character
   - For even length: Places start at the first of the two center characters

3. **Length Calculation**: `right - left - 1` in expandAroundCenter works because:
   - When the while loop ends, left and right have gone one step too far
   - Subtracting and adjusting by 1 gives us the correct length

## Testing the Solution

Try these test cases:
1. "racecar" → "racecar" (odd length)
2. "abba" → "abba" (even length)
3. "babad" → "bab" or "aba" (multiple possible answers)
4. "cbbd" → "bb" (even length within larger string)
5. "a" → "a" (single character)
6. "ac" → "a" or "c" (no palindrome longer than 1)

## Time and Space Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n²) where n is the length of the string
- Space Complexity: O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space

This solution provides a clean and efficient way to solve the longest palindrome problem while being easy to understand and implement.
